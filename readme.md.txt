## Introduction

Welcome to OpenSciConnect by ConnectX! Our platform is designed to connect project creators in open science and open-source projects with skilled collaborators. 
We believe in fostering collaboration, building professional relationships, and sharing expertise within the open research community.

##The Challenge we choose
A Marketplace for Open Science Project

## The problem we are solving
In the realm of open science and open-source projects, there is currently no streamlined method for project creators to find and connect with individuals who have the specific skills required to contribute to their projects. 
Likewise, individuals interested in participating in open research initiatives struggle to identify projects that align with their expertise and interests. 
The absence of a dedicated platform for matching project creators with collaborators hinders the growth and efficiency of open science initiatives.

## The solution
Our platform, OpenSciConnect, addresses this problem by providing a solution that facilitates the identification, connection, and
communication between project creators and skilled contributors, thus fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the open research community.

## Impact
